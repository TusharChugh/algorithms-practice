## Key Points

0. Two lists implementations - simple_int_list.h and forward_list.h. Former is easier to use and preferred to use during the interviews ( to make things fast), later is not a robust implementation but just a peak of how forward_list like STL can be implemented.

## Questions
1. Does the list contain integers or any other type
2. Integers positive or negative
3. Forward or doubly linked list
4. Can we have begin and end elements?
5. Can we assume we are adding this to STL like container? 

## General approached
1. Runners technique (with separation distance of 2 or more {like in kth_tolast.h})
2. Recursion
3. Iterative
4. Creating new linked lists is not expensive as in arrays.
