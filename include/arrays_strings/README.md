# Common questions and Test cases
1. Can the input be empty?
2. Upper case vs lower case
3. How big the input can be?
4. Can we use extra space?

# Common patterns
1. Create an array/vector of size (= NUM ASCII)
2. Create an array/vector of size (= NUM INPUTS)
3. Hash sets and hash maps are useful. 
4. In STL unordered_map and unordered_set containers provide O(1) are implemented using hash
5. In STL map and set are ordered and are implemented by Red-Black trees (O(log(N)) look-up time)
